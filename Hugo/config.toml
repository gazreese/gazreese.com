Similar in features to platforms such as Scoreloop and OpenFeint, it included a dynamic news feed, editorial marketing, geographic leaderboards, inter-user challenges and a virtual goods and currencies system. The Crystal social gaming platform played a lead role in Chillingo’s acquisition by Electronic Arts in 2010, and post-acquisition my role has expanded considerably.\n\nTo address security and reliability concerns with our external developer partners I have established a Due Diligence consultancy process. This is a thorough and systematic review of the developer’s systems and processes covering areas such as hosting, scalability, security, reliability and data protection.\n\nMy time with EA and the ever-growing regulatory requirements of connected social systems has given me a broad understanding and respect for the legal challenges it faces. My team develop a legal SDK, which is included with all Chillingo and most EA Mobile titles. This SDK and back-end ensures the compliance of our titles against the various requirements around the world.\n\nMy team also develop cross promotional tools that take advantage of the Electronic Arts userbase to deliver video and in-game promotional content at scale."
